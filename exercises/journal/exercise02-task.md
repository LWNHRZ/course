# Exercise 2 - The Famer

Instead of farming for itself in solitude as in exercise 1, your agent is now interacting with others through a common market. In fact, there will be multiple instances of your agent class in the simulation and not just one. The resulting score is the average of these instances.

The utility and production functions are still the same as the last time, but maybe we can do better collectively?

Note that the simulation is configured such that in the efficient equilibrium, the optimal number of firms is lower than number of consumers.

If you want, you can solve this problem mathematically. Alternatively, you can also just play around with your [Farmer class](../src/com/agentecon/exercise2/Farmer.java) and the [Farm](../src/com/agentecon/exercise2/Farmer.java) he is creating to find out how to achieve a better utility. After having pushed your code to github, you can check out the [resulting ranking online](http://meissereconomics.com/vis/simulation?sim=ex2-farmer).

Document your findings in the [lab journal](exercise02-journal.md) as you try out different ideas to make your agent behave well.

The deadline for submitting your hermit and the lab journal to github is 2017-10-05 at 24:00.
