# Exercise 1 - The Hermit

![hermit](images/hermit.jpg A hermit's house)

A hermit is an autarkic consumer that does not interact with other agents. The hermit has a production function that turns man-hours into food.

Your task is to program your own hermit with an optimal work-life balance, as the hermit enjoys both, food and man-hours spent as leisure time.

You can start with the given [Hermit class](../src/com/agentecon/exercise1/Hermit.java) and adjust the function 'produce', in which the hermit decides how much time to spend on growing food.

It is possible to edit this class directly on github.com and then check the [resulting ranking online](http://meissereconomics.com/vis/simulation?sim=ex1-hermit). However, in practice, it is much more efficient to edit and test a local copy of your agents before uploading (pushing) them to github, a process which is described [here](http://meissereconomics.com/course/setup).

Document your findings in the [lab journal](exercise01 - journal.md) as you try out different ideas to make your hermit behave optimally.

The deadline for submitting your hermit and the lab journal to github is 2017-09-21 at 24:00.
